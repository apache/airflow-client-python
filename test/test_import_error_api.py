    Airflow API. All endpoints located under ``/api/v2`` can be used safely, are stable and backward compatible. Endpoints located under ``/ui`` are dedicated to the UI and are subject to breaking change depending on the need of the frontend. Users should not rely on those but use the public ones instead.
