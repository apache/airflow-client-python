DAG

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**dag_id** | **str** | The ID of the DAG. | [optional] [readonly] 
**root_dag_id** | **str, none_type** | If the DAG is SubDAG then it is the top level DAG identifier. Otherwise, null. | [optional] [readonly] 
**is_paused** | **bool, none_type** | Whether the DAG is paused. | [optional] 
**is_active** | **bool, none_type** | Whether the DAG is currently seen by the scheduler(s). | [optional] [readonly] 
**is_subdag** | **bool** | Whether the DAG is SubDAG. | [optional] [readonly] 
**fileloc** | **str** | The absolute path to the file. | [optional] [readonly] 
**file_token** | **str** | The key containing the encrypted path to the file. Encryption and decryption take place only on the server. This prevents the client from reading an non-DAG file. This also ensures API extensibility, because the format of encrypted data may change.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**owners** | **[str]** |  | [optional] [readonly] 
**description** | **str, none_type** | User-provided DAG description, which can consist of several sentences or paragraphs that describe DAG contents.  | [optional] [readonly]
